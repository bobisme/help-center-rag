# VINlink Decoder Configuration

VINlink Decoder is a Canadian tool that ensures that VIN numbers are valid and
belong to the described vehicles. Rather than enter a username and password
every time you use this tool, you can configure VINlink Decoder to submit that
information automatically to the WebVINlink website.
