# Quote Results

On the *Quote Results* screen, you can view and compare carrier rates, review
quote details, add additional quotes to the session, prepare agency-branded
proposals, and finalize a quote.

You may be prompted to select a username/password combination and/or a code to
use for the rate you are running if you have multiple credentials or codes saved
for the same carrier. If so, select a **username/password** and/or a **code**
and click the **Use Login Info** button.

To edit risk detail for the quote from the *Quote Results* screen, click the
**button** that displays the quote’s line type beside the *+ Quote* button.

You can add additional quotes to the same session on the *Quote Results* screen
(for example, if the client wants a Homeowners as well as a Personal Auto
quote). All quotes in the session display on the *Quote Results* screen,
although they will have separate results and will need to be accepted
separately. If you accept multiple quotes, the system will create them as
separate monoline policies, not as a package policy.

If you cannot complete the quote within a single session and want to save it to
accept later, click the **View All of Account’s Quotes** link label. When you
are ready to resume the workflow, select the **quote** in the client’s Quotes
list (where it will have a status of *In Progress*) and click the **View Quote
Results** link label in the *Carrier Rates* header.

## Adding Quotes

You can add additional quotes to the same session if necessary. The information
that copies to the new quote depends on the option you use to add it and the
line of business you select.

To add additional quotes to the same session, do one of the following:

* Add Quote

  The *Add Quote* option copies the information from the selected quote’s
  *Applicant* and *Address* tabs to the new quote automatically.

  1. Click the **Add Quote** button ![](output/images/aHR0cHM6_Quote_plus.png).
  2. Click **Continue to Copy** on the pop-up message to proceed to the Quote Information window.
  3. Complete the *Quote Information* fields for the new quote and click **Finish**.
  4. Risk detail displays for the selected line of business. Click on the **Applicant** and **Address** tabs to review the information that copied from the existing quote and modify this information if necessary.
  5. Once you have completed risk detail, click the **Get Quotes** button to submit the quote for rating and proceed to the *Quote Results* screen.
* Copy Quote

  The *Copy Quote* option copies all risk detail information (excluding *Quote
  Results* rates) from the selected quote to a new quote for the same line of
  business. If you select a different line of business for the new quote, however,
  only the *Applicant* and *Address* information copies from the existing quote.

  1. Right click on the **button** ![](output/images/aHR0cHM6_Auto.png) for the quote you want to copy and select **Copy Quote** from the dropdown menu.
  2. Click **Continue** **to Copy** on the pop-up message to proceed to the Quote Information window.
  3. Complete the *Quote Information* fields for the new quote and click **Finish**.
  4. Risk detail displays for the selected line of business. Click on each **tab** to review the copied information and modify it if necessary.
  5. Once you have completed risk detail, click the **Get Quotes** button to submit the quote for rating and proceed to the *Quote Results* screen.

## Quote Results List

The *Quote Results* screen displays a list of carriers who provided a rate for
your quote based on the risk detail you entered on the *Quoting Session* screen,
and whose websites are selected in Quote Setup. A *Credit Check* icon   displays
beside any carrier that performed a credit check when providing a rate.

If you did not configure an agent/producer code for a carrier in Quotes Setup,
enter your **code** and click **Get Rate** in the *Premium* column to get a rate
for the quote from that carrier. To save this agent/producer code to Quotes
Setup for future use with the carrier, click **Save**.

If a carrier in the list requires information you did not enter in risk detail
to provide a rate, hover over the *Required Information Needed* text in the
*Premium* column to display the required fields in a tooltip. Click on the
**tooltip text** to return to the Quoting Session to enter this information.
Then refresh the *Quote Results* to view the additional rates.

Click the **Delete** button ![](output/images/aHR0cHM6_Quote_Delete.png) beside
any rate you want to remove from the list, to give you a cleaner view of the
rates you are considering for the quote. Deleting a rate moves it to the bottom
of the list and clears the premium listed for it.

You can do the following on the *Quotes Results* list:

* Start Website Quote

  If you want a rate from a carrier without an Instant rate listed, you can access
  the carrier’s website directly from the *Quote Results* screen and perform a
  *Live Fill* quote. Applied Epic fields will pre-fill on the carrier’s website.

  1. Click the **Start Website Quote** button.
  2. The *Start Website Quote* window displays. Select a **Carrier Website**.
  3. Click the **Launch to Carrier** button. The carrier’s website opens.
  4. Once you save the quote from the carrier website, it displays in the *Quote Results* list.
* Refresh Rates

  If you made a change to risk detail or want to see whether a carrier’s premium
  has changed, click the **Refresh Rates** button. When prompted, confirm that you
  want to clear all current Instant rates and replace them with new ones. Once
  clicked, the button displays as unavailable for one minute or until all rates
  are returned.
* Save Manual Quote

  If you obtain a rate and a premium from a carrier outside of Quotes, you can add
  the rate to the *Quote Results* list manually, compare it with other rates, and
  use the data you entered to populate risk detail if you choose to finalize the
  sale for this quote.

  1. Click the **Save Manual Quote** button.
  2. The *Save Manual Quote* window displays. Select a **Carrier** from the dropdown menu.
  3. If the risk is not eligible with this carrier, select the **Ineligible** checkbox to disable the *Premium* and *Term* fields and display *Ineligible* for the premium in the *Quote Results* list.
  4. Enter the **Premium** for the quote.
  5. The *Term* defaults to *6 months*. Select a different **Term** if necessary.
  6. Optionally enter information about the quote in the **Agent Notes** field.
  7. Click **Save Quote** to add the manual quote to the *Quote Results* list.

  To make changes to a manual quote, click the **Edit** button
  ![](output/images/aHR0cHM6_Quote_Edit.png) beside it in the *Quote Results*
  list.
* Prepare Proposal

  Generate an agency-branded proposal to share with your client. In the proposal,
  you can present multiple carrier rates, indicate recommended rates, and provide
  a coverage comparison for the rates included.

  Carrier logos only display on proposals for carriers with an *Instant* rate
  connection. Other carriers’ names display in plain text.

  1. Click the **Prepare Proposal** button.
  2. The *Prepare Proposal* window lists all carrier rates for each quote in the session, regardless of the line of business (auto or home). Select the **Included** checkbox for each rate you want to include in the proposal. To include all rates, click the **Include All** link label.
  3. To recommend one or more of these rates to the client, select the rate’s **Recommended** checkbox. Recommended rates display a star ![](output/images/aHR0cHM6_Quotes_star.png) on the proposal.
  4. If you want to compare the rates you have selected as *Included* to the rates you originally requested without generating a branded proposal, click the **Quick Compare** link label.  
        
      To generate an unbranded PDF of the rate comparison, click the **PDF** button ![](output/images/aHR0cHM6_Quotes_PDF.png). You are prompted to save the file. Confirm the location and file name and click **Save**. If you are accessing Epic from a web browser, Epic uses your browser’s PDF settings to save the rate comparison.  
        
      Click the **X** in the upper right-hand corner to close the popup when you have finished reviewing the rates or saving the rate comparison.
  5. Click the **Next** button to continue preparing the proposal.
  6. Your agency’s contact information defaults in the *Agency Info* section, but you can update this information if necessary. Any changes you make will be saved when you save the proposal and will default the next time you prepare a proposal.  
        
      To restore the default *Agency Info*, click the **Reset to Defaults** link label.
  7. Enter a brief **Summary** of the proposal’s content. You can also add any disclaimers you need to provide to your client or your reasons for recommending particular rates.
  8. To view your changes to the proposal, click **Update Preview**.  
        
      In the *Preview* section, you can do the following:
  + Click the **Zoom In** ![](output/images/aHR0cHM6_Quotes_plus.png) or **Zoom Out** button ![](output/images/aHR0cHM6_Quotes_minus.png) to zoom.
  + Click the **View Full Screen** button ![](output/images/aHR0cHM6_Quotes_expand.png) to view the proposal full screen. Click **Close** to close the *Proposal Preview* window when you are finished.9. Click the **Save and Export** button to generate a PDF of the proposal. You are prompted to save the file. Confirm the location and file name and click **Save**.  
        
      If you are accessing Epic from a web browser, Epic uses your browser’s PDF settings to save the proposal.

Once you have obtained all quotes and selected a rate, click the **Proceed to
Carrier** button ![](output/images/aHR0cHM6_Quotes_Carrier.png) for that rate
and follow your normal workflow to bind the coverage on the carrier’s client
portal. All quote information is merged and available on the portal.

## Quote Details

*Quote Details* display for your current selection in the *Quote Results* list.

If the carrier sent a carrier proposal with their rate, click the **View Carrier
Proposal** button to view it. This proposal does not attach to the client’s
policy or account automatically, but you can save the proposal as a PDF and
attach it manually if necessary. SeeAdd an Attachment for details.

The following tabs are available to view in *Quote Details*:

* **Coverages:** Displays both the coverages the client requested and the coverages the carrier used. If the carrier’s coverage is greater or less than the coverage the client requested, an up or down arrow displays beside it.
* **Messages:** Specific information about the rate returned (for example, any surcharges or discounts from the carrier)
* **Changes:** Changes that the carrier made to the quote
* **Defaults:** Any values that defaulted for the quote
* **Payment Options:** Payment plans available to the client
* **Agent Notes:** Enter additional details about the carrier rate here. These notes are saved with the quote for future reference, but they do not copy to the resulting policy if you accept the quote. You can also add notes in this area after accepting the quote if necessary.

Once you have finished reviewing the quote and have finalized it on the
carrier’s client portal, click the **Mark as Sold** button to proceed to the
Accept Quote window, where you will create the policy.
