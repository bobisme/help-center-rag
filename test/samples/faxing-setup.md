This function allows you to set up faxing for incoming and outgoing faxes. You
can set COM port settings, *Brooktrout* settings, and dialing rules.

The Integrated Faxing Application is already a part of Applied Epic; however, a
license is required to activate the application. This is activated by installing
the Fax Server Client (FSC) on the dedicated fax server. Click here for
installation instructions.

Once you have installed the Fax Server Client, use the following instructions to
configure your faxing.

1. From the Home screen, do one of the following:  
    
   * Click **Configure** on the navigation panel.
   * Click the **down arrow** next to *Home* on the menubar and select **Configure**.
   * Click **Areas > Configure** on the menubar.

From any other area of the program, do one of the following:

2. * Click the **down arrow** to the right of the *Home* options bar button and select **Configure**.
   * Click **Home > Configure** on the menubar. The *Configure* screen displays.

2. Click **Job Management** on the navigation panel, or **Areas > Job Management** on the menubar.
3. Click **Fax Setup** on the navigation panel.
4. If this is your first time configuring faxing setup, the list at the top of the screen is blank. Click the **Add** button to add a Fax Server Client.
5. You are presented with a list of workstations in your system with the Fax Server Client installed. Because only one Fax Server Client can be associated per database, in many cases you will only run it on one station. Check the appropriate **workstation(s)** and click **Finish**.
6. The *Fax Server Client IP Address* you just added displays in the list with a *Status* of *Pending* (meaning connection is still being established). Click the **Refresh** button at the top of the list to monitor the current status.
7. When the *Status* changes to *Attached*, the Fax Server Client is available to be configured. Highlight the **Fax Server Client** in the list and click the **Edit** button.
8. Fill out the following fields beneath the list:  
   * **Fax server client name**- Enter the computer name running the Fax Server Client or an alternate identifier for the workstation.
   * **Outgoing fax ID**- It is recommended to enter the phone number in use or an alternate identifier for the line.
   * **Retry count**- Enter the number of times you would like Applied Epic to reattempt sending a fax if a failure is encountered. If you do not enter a value of at least 1 in this field, no additional attempts will be made after a fax fails to send.
   * **Retry wait time (in seconds)**- Enter the number of seconds the Fax Server Client should wait after a failure before retrying. The recommended value is 180 (three minutes).
9. Fill out any applicable information on the four tabs below:  
   * COM Port Settings: If you are using *Brooktrout* channels only, you may skip this tab.

     1. The *COM Port Settings* list shows all communication ports available on the machine running the Fax Server Client. Check the **port(s)** that will be used.
     2. Highlight each selected port and select a **Port functionality** from the dropdown list:
        + **Send/Receive:** Select this option if you only have one communication port and must use it for both functions. If you have multiple ports, you may wish to designate one as *Receive Only* so that it will be available to receive faxes even while you are sending faxes.
        + **Send Only**
        + **Receive Only**
     3. Make the appropriate selections in the *Advanced COM Port Settings* frame:
        1. Determine whether you will enable *Error correction mode*. This transmission mode means that if the modem receives a fax containing bad data and cannot correct it, it will request that the sender return only the bad block of data, rather than the entire fax. Not all modems support ECM. Check your modem hardware before selecting one of the following:
           + **Enable ECM:** If you select this option and your modem hardware does not support ECM, you may experience errors when sending faxes.
           + **Disable ECM:** If ECM is disabled, the modem requests that the entire fax be resent when bad data is received.
           + **Allow ECM & Non-ECM:** If in doubt, select this option. This works for any setup, including a setup that supports ECM when sending faxes but not when receiving them.
        2. In the *Number of rings to wait before answering* field, enter **1** or **2**. You may wish to wait two rings if you have a complex phone system and want to ensure the fax has enough time to reach the modem.
        3. Optionally select **Hear modem speaker until connection is made**.
   * Brooktrout Settings: Applicable only if the Fax Server Client has a *Brooktrout* card installed.

     1. The *Brooktrout Channels* list shows all channels available on the machine running the Fax Server Client. Check the **channel(s)** that will be used.
     2. Highlight each selected channel and select a **Channel functionality** from the dropdown list:
        + **Send/Receive**
        + **Send Only**
        + **Receive Only**
     3. If your *Brooktrout* card supports Direct Inward Dialing, you can set it up in the *Routing for Direct Inward Dialing* frame. This feature enables you to route faxes directly to specific employees based on their Direct Inward Dialing numbers (the last four digits or their fax numbers).  
           
         **Note:** The *Brooktrout* channel used for Direct Inward Dialing must have a *Channel functionality* of *Receive Only*.
        1. Click the **Add** button to the left of the list. The *Add DID Routing* window displays.
        2. Check **All numbers** if all faxes should be routed to a single employee. If you are going to set up multiple routing recipients, leave *All numbers* unchecked and enter the last four digits of the first employeeâ€™s fax number in the *DID #* field.
        3. Select the corresponding **employee code** from the *Routing Recipient* dropdown list.
        4. To add another Direct Inward Dialing routing, click **Add**. When you are done adding routings, click **Finish**.
   * Area Code/Prefix Routing: Applicable only if you have multiple Fax Server Clients and would like to determine which faxes are sent from which Fax Server Client.

     1. Click the **Add** button to the left of the *Area Code* list to enter the area code you are faxing from.
     2. Enter the **code**. Click **Add** to enter any additional codes. When you are done adding area codes, click **Finish**.
     3. Highlight each **area code** and select a radio button in the *Prefixes* frame:
        + **Route all prefixes from the selected area code to the selected fax server client**
        + **Route selected prefixes from the selected area code to the selected fax server client:** If you select this option, check the appropriate **prefixes** in the list. You can also click *Select Range* to enter a range of prefixes to which this rule applies.
   * Dialing Options

     1. In the *General Dialing Rules* frame, enter your local area code in the *Area code dialing from* field.
     2. If you must dial any extra numbers in order to make a local call outside your organization, enter them in the *To access an outside line for local calls dial* field.
     3. If you must dial any extra numbers in order to make a long-distance call outside your organization, enter them in the *To access an outside line for long-distance calls dial* field.  
           
         **Note:** The Fax Server Client automatically dials 1 before long distance calls. Do **not** enter 1 in this field unless you must dial 1 twice to make long-distance calls. For example, if you need to dial 9 to access an outside line, but your phone system has no other special requirements, you should simply enter 9 for step b and step c.
     4. In the *International Dialing Rules* frame, enter your local country code in the *Country code dialing from* field.
     5. In the *International exit code* field, enter the code that must be used to fax internationally.
     6. To ensure your dialing rules are correct, click **Verify Dialing Options**. Enter a phone number (in ten-digit format, including area code) in the field provided and click **Continue**. The system displays the number as it would be dialed by the Fax Server Client, using the current dialing rules.
     7. If your phone system requires any special dialing rules for certain circumstances, you may enter them in the *Custom Dialing Rules* list. Click the **Add** button to enter a new rule.
        1. Enter the **Area code calling** to which this rule applies.
        2. Select the **Apply rules to all prefixes** or **Apply rules to selected prefixes** radio button. If you are applying the rule to selected prefixes only, highlight the appropriate **prefixes** in the list. You can press *[Ctrl]* while clicking to select multiple prefixes.
        3. Select the appropriate checkboxes:
           + **Dial \_\_\_ before:** Enter the correct number in the field.
           + **Include the area code**
           + **Dial \_\_\_ after:** Enter the correct number in the field.
        4. Click **Add** if you need to add another rule. When you are done adding rules, click **Finish**. You may also click **Cancel** to discard changes made.
