# Email

Applied Epic allows you to launch an integrated email client from within the
system for all routine email workflows except those initiated by Distribution
Manager. Your organization may opt to use *Microsoft Outlook* or an Epic custom
message window for this integration, or allow you to make an individual
selection in Email Settings Configuration. Regardless of the option you are
using, do one of the following to access your email:

* From the Home screen, click **Email** on the navigation panel or **Areas > Email** on the menubar.
* To access email from any other part of the program, click the **down arrow** next to *Home* on the options bar and select **Email**.

**Note:** If you are using *Microsoft Outlook*, *Outlook* opens to the last
window you accessed. This window may open in focus or minimized in the taskbar.

## Epic Email

This is a custom message window unique to Applied Epic. It contains the
functionality you would expect from most email clients and is comprised of the
